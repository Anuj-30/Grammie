# GRAMMIE by React

<b> This is my first Project wihout any tutorial so check it out</b>
<h2>Description</h2>
This is my grammer checker website for projects It works with 6 different langagues you can add more by changing in codes.

<h2>Usage</h2>
1. React
2. tailwind css
3. Api:-Languagetool api

<h2>Integrations</h2>
 The option value gets a langague code and set it in api
 Than input gets text and stored it in array
 api checks and give an matches array for mistakes plus replacement array for suggestions
 than print it 
 it is basically simple working but the integrations with apis are complex because of there structure and data accessing 
 so read code and readme properly before change codes in it
